# Accessing with your data

Glassium has a cascade data strucrture that starts with lowest possible layer to the high level one. The lowest layer is the `session`. Sessions are a segments of human experiences that currently is just an audio file with a date. The next layer is `transcription` layer that transcribes the audio file to text. Then using the transcribed data agents could create `memory` or use the data to build a context for them.

## Sessions

Each session consists of `date`, `duration`, `state`, optional `transctiption` and optional `classification`. 

To get `sessions` you need to make a `GET` request to the `/v1/sessions` endpoint. You can also get a single session by making a `GET` request to the `/v1/sessions/:id` endpoint.
